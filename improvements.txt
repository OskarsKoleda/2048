1. Immutability
Some utility functions (e.g., addNewNumbers) mutate the board in place. For React state management and predictable behavior, prefer returning a new board instead of mutating the input.

2. Type Safety
You already use TypeScript, but some functions could benefit from more explicit types. For example, generateInitialBoard and addNewNumbers could have explicit return types.

3. Constants
You have BOARD_SIZE as a constant, which is good. Consider using it everywhere instead of hardcoded 4 (e.g., in isThereMoveLeft).

4. UI/UX
Add animations for tile movement and merging for a more engaging experience.
Add a "Best Score" feature using localStorage.
Add touch controls for mobile devices.

5. Testing ✅
Your test coverage is good. Consider adding tests for the main React components (e.g., GameBoard, Menu) using a library like React Testing Library.

6. Code Organization
Move hooks to a src/hooks/ directory for better separation.
Consider grouping utility functions by domain (e.g., all board operations in one file).

7. Accessibility
Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for better accessibility.
Ensure color contrast is sufficient for all users.

8. Performance ✅
Use React.memo for components like Square to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

9. Styling
Consider using CSS variables for colors to make theme changes easier.
Use CSS modules or styled-components consistently for all components.

10. Code Comments & Documentation
Add more comments to complex logic (e.g., matrix operations).
Expand the README.md with instructions, features, and screenshots.
